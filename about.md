  Hey. I'm Ryan. I make things with data. I used to do it more publicly when I wasn't doing it all day at work, but I still find time to on occasion.
<br><br>
  I started working in data at the <a href="http://radio.physics.unb.ca/jayachandran/">University of New Brunswick's Radio Physics Lab</a> in 2007. Fast forward a few years and I was a data and analytics product manager at <a href="https://www.serenova.com/">Serenova</a> after they acquired the start-up I was working for. 
  <br><br>
  I later worked as a Senior Data Scientist at <a href="https://shopify.com/">Shopify</a> for 4 years, and I am currently doing the same at <a href="https://www.wealthsimple.com/">Wealthsimple</a>.

Here's my GitHub: [Brideau](https://github.com/brideau)

You're already on my blog so you know where that is.
