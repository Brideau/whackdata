  Hey. I'm Ryan. I make things with data.
<br><br>
  I used to be the data & analytics product manager at LiveOps Cloud, but these days I am a data visualization researcher in the University of New Brunswick's Geodesy and Geomatics Engineering department. I'm currently based in Kitchener, Ontario (Canada) as I finish my thesis.

Here's my GitHub: [Brideau](https://github.com/brideau)

You're already on my blog so you know where that is.

Questions about something I made? You can e-mail me directly at **ryan dot brideau at Google's email service dot com**.
