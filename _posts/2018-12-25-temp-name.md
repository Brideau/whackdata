When I first saw Randall Munroe's [Drain the Oceans](https://what-if.xkcd.com/53/) in his book _[What If?](https://www.amazon.com/What-If-Scientific-Hypothetical-Questions/dp/0544272994/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1513527935&sr=8-3)_, I was dumbfounded. He had drawn a map of what the world would look like if somebody removed a 10m diameter plug in the Marianas Trench and let the world's water drain out, and I had no idea how he did it.

Looking closely at the resulting map, I could tell that this wasn't guesswork, and that it wasn't a simple case where you just find all parts of the Earth with an elevation higher than the trench, because in that case everything would be dry. He had actually simulated it...somehow.

Fast forward a couple years

## Calling ogr2ogr

We'll be using Futures to keep things nice and asynchronous, so you'll need to import them and a few other things a the top of your class:

{% gist Brideau/ea1c98c089208fa363e12b2f8ee55154 imports.scala %}

Next, add this function that will be used to create a folder to hold your output and to call ogr2ogr to perform the conversion:

{% gist Brideau/ea1c98c089208fa363e12b2f8ee55154 convertUsingOgr2Ogr.scala %}

Finally, build up your ogr2ogr command using [their documentation](http://www.gdal.org/ogr2ogr.html) and the output driver's specific documentation, just as you would if running it from the command line. Store it as an array of strings. For example, to output as a Shapefile, just Google _ogr2ogr driver shapefile_ to find [this page](http://www.gdal.org/drv_shapefile.html).
