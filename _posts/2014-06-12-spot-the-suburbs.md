<span>I just started playing with CartoDB today, and I can already tell how much time it is going to save me when doing any kind of map plotting - this thing is incredibly powerful.</span>

Just to test things out, I uploaded all of the building locations in Fredericton (which unfortunately was too much for my tiny trial account, and I had to split it) and colour coded them by their street designation.

Nothing spectacular here, but it's pretty interesting how quickly you can spot the suburbs with their many "Crescents" and "Courts":&nbsp;
