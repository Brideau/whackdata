title: Launching Citizens Code

This blog has gone silent for a few months, but there's a good reason for that! Last week, I attended GovMaker where I launched [Citizens Code: an organization that matches people with domain knowledge of the problems that face our cities and governments, with technically-inclined citizens that want to help to solve those problems.](http://www.citizenscode.org/)

It's geared toward people with day jobs that that want to apply their expertise and spare time to advance public policy, raise the level of civic dialog, and improve our cities. And it's not just about 'building apps.' The work we'll do will span from data journalism & data visualization, to making government data more accessible, to looking for applications for low-cost computing to change the ways we make decisions about how we build our cities.

There's a regular ole website, of course: [www.citizenscode.org](http://www.citizenscode.org/) But more importantly, there's a community as well where these ideas will take shape and come to life: [ideas.citizenscode.org](http://ideas.citizenscode.org/)

If you're interested in contributing, or are just interested in learning how this all works, join in! We'd love to have you.
