**UPDATE Jul 30th:** Because of the huge uptake of this and the rapidly changing nature of new software, these instructions are themselves changing quickly. To help keep things manageable, I've moved all of this content into the Github wiki: <https://github.com/Brideau/pokelyzer/wiki>

If you have any issues with them, please create a ticket here: <https://github.com/Brideau/pokelyzer/issues>

Thank you for all your feedback and support.
